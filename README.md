# Network_Engineering_Labs
# Junior Network Engineer Lab Portfolio

## Overview

This repository documents my structured, hands-on journey toward becoming a Network Engineer, aligned with CCNA fundamentals and real-world enterprise networking practices.

The goal of this lab portfolio is not only to learn networking concepts, but to demonstrate practical implementation, troubleshooting ability, and structured documentation similar to real project environments.

All labs are built using Cisco Packet Tracer and follow industry-relevant design principles.

## Learning Philosophy

Networking is best learned by building, breaking, troubleshooting, and documenting.

Each lab in this repository includes:

- Clear objective and scenario
- Network topology design
- IP addressing plan
- Device configurations
- Verification steps
- Troubleshooting documentation
- Lessons learned

The focus is on understanding *why* configurations are applied — not just typing commands.

---

## Lab Structure

The labs are organized into three progressive levels:

### 🟢 Level 1 – Beginner (Foundations)

Focus:
- IPv4 addressing
- Subnetting
- Basic routing
- VLAN fundamentals
- Default gateway concepts
- Basic troubleshooting
- Understanding Cisco CLI modes

Goal:
Build strong Layer 1–3 foundations aligned with CCNA.

---

### 🟡 Level 2 – Intermediate (Enterprise Concepts)

Focus:
- VLAN segmentation
- Trunking
- Router-on-a-stick
- Static and dynamic routing (OSPF)
- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Network Address Translation (NAT)
- Basic firewall concepts
- Redundancy fundamentals

Goal:
Simulate real small-to-medium enterprise network designs.

---

### 🔴 Level 3 – Advanced (Consulting-Level Design & Troubleshooting)

Focus:
- Multi-site topology
- Dynamic routing protocols (OSPF areas, BGP basics)
- Site-to-site VPN concepts
- High availability concepts
- Network segmentation strategies
- Failure simulations and root cause analysis
- Structured troubleshooting methodology
- Network design documentation

Goal:
Demonstrate project-ready thinking and problem-solving suitable for consulting environments.

---

## Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cisco IOS CLI
- GitHub for documentation
- Structured troubleshooting methodology

---

## Objective

To develop practical networking skills and demonstrate readiness for junior network engineering roles through consistent lab building, documentation, and progressive complexity.

This repository will continue evolving as I advance from foundational networking to enterprise-level design and troubleshooting.
